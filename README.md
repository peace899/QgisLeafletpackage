# QgisLeafletpackage
An experimental QGIS plugin to export QGIS project to a Leaflet webmap.

For a comprehensive QGIS export use [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web).
This plugin packages your vectorlayers to a GeoPackage. It utilises a single JavaScript script to read the Geopackage, build layertree, load and style layers  (where possible..) in the browser.

To use download the plugin.zip and extract to your plugins folder.
